# Product_Search_Relevance_Prediction

Problem Statement
The task is simple to understand. For any search query that the customer enters, I need to find the most relevant products and show them to the user in order of their relevance. From a business point of view, there are a few points which need to be considered. First, the products need to be ranked, thus, even among the most relevant products, we need to be able to tell which one is more relevant. Second, there is a time constraint involved i.e. the results need to be shown within seconds.
